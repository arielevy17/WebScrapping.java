Project Name: Search Engine
General description: The system will scan news websites and look for an entry entered by the user in their various articles. All matching articles will be displayed for the user.
Detail: When running the program, a window (GUI) will open in which a text box and a button will appear. 
The user will be able to enter a word/phrase into the text box, and after clicking the button, Web Scrapers will be run on four news sites.
The scraper will read all the articles to which the main page of the news site refers,
and for each article in which there is a match to the search value, the information in the following format will appear in the GUI window:
- Link
- Title
- The content of the article
  
The search for the articles will be carried out in an infinite loop. 
That is, immediately after the scraper has finished scanning the site it is working on, it will perform another scan to check if additional articles with the search value have been created in the meantime. 
The maximum number of matches to be displayed is 4. If four articles are already displayed, and another article is found that meets the search value, 
the oldest article should be pushed out, and the new article found should be displayed.
